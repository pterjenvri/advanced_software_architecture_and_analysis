The digitalization of manufacturing with Industry 4.0 technologies are changing industries throughout the world. This comes with a lot of challenges, such as interoperability and flexible production in robotics and automated production system software. This paper proposes a software architecture for the production system of a pharmaceutical company with specific requirements. This paper approaches this problem through use cases to prompt the design phase of the architecture and to come up with specific quality attributes and requirements that the software should strive for. To evaluate the chosen architecture tactics and patterns, the verification tool UPPAAL has been utilized to formally verify the software architecture. Experiments have also been conducted, in a Dockerized environment, to show that the system's capabilities are documented and validated. The results of these evaluation tools show that the design has been successful in achieving higher availability and integrability.
